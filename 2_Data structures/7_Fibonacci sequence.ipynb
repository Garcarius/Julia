    "# Fibonacci sequence\n",
    "You are working on a script to calculate the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence is a famous sequence of numbers that appears in nature in many places.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first two numbers in the sequence are 0 and 1. The numbers after that are each equal to the sum of the two numbers which come before them. So the start of the sequence is `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5,....`\n",
    "\n",
    "The first several digits of the Fibonacci sequence have been calculated for you and are stored in the integer array fibonacci, which is available in your environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculate the next number in the sequence fibonacci by adding its last two terms.\n",
    "* Add the new term to the end of the fibonacci array using the push!() function."
