    "# Conditioning on body temperature\n",
    "Let's say you were tasked with programming a diagnostic tool that assesses a patient's body temperature. You want to print warnings if the temperature is too high or too low and a reassuring message if it is just right. In this exercise, you'll write a conditional expression to aid the diagnosis.\n",

    "* Print the message `\"Might be a fever\"` if body_temp is more than 37.6.\n",
